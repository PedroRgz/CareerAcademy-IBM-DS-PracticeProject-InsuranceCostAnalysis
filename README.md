## Introduction

In this project, I applied various data analysis and visualization techniques to a medical insurance dataset to gain insights and predict insurance costs. The dataset includes features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region, which are used to predict the insurance costs.

## Installation

To install the necessary libraries, use the following commands:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PedroRgz/CareerAcademy-IBM-DS-PracticeProject-InsuranceCostAnalysis.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd CareerAcademy-IBM-DS-PracticeProject-InsuranceCostAnalysis
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook InsuranceCostAnalysis.ipynb
    ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code cells and perform the analysis.
